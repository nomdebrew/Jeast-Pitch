		<p>Currently there is a shortage of expert knowledge in regards yeast management in the brewing industry. There are yeast calculators available, but they lack the scope of a yeast management system and the depth needed to accurately address a variety of situation. In regards to yeast yeast, craft breweries fall into one of two camps. First, they buy more than they need and the rest gets wasted or secondly too little yeast is purchased leading to production issues. If there was a yeast management system to tell you the exact amount based on what you want to make, people could save time and money.</p>
